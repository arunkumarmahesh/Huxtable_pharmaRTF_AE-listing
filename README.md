# Huxtable_pharmaRTF_AE-listing

### Huxtable is a package for creating text tables. It is powerful, but easy to use. Huxtableâ€™s features include:

- Export to LaTeX, HTML, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Powerpoint, RTF and Markdown
- Easy integration with knitr and rmarkdown documents
- Formatted on-screen display
- Multirow and multicolumn cells
- Fine-grained control over cell background, spacing, alignment, size and borders
- Control over text font, style, size, colour, alignment, number format and rotation
- Table manipulation using standard R subsetting, or dplyr functions like filter and select
- Easy conditional formatting based on table contents
- Quick table themes
- Automatic creation of regression output tables with the huxreg function

### pharmaRTF consumes a huxtable table and fills in the missing pieces by offering:
 
- Document property options
- Proper multi-page display
- Titles and footnotes stored within the document headers and footers
